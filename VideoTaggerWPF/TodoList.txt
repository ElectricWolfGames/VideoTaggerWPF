Video tagger to do list :

Need to do before release:
+ Sort the tags by name - Done 
+ Options page 
-	DONE: Auto play next video
-	DONE: Use datetime format as the first part of the file name
+ DONE: Remove tag from list (add an red x to each tag name) 
  The red x should be on the far right on the tag list.

Nice to have:
+ Filter the current tags
